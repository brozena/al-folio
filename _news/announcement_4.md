I posted my [N-of-1 analysis](/var/) on four years of my own [Oura
Ring](https://www.ouraring.com/) sleep data and mood logs. Oura's sleep score
was shown to [Granger-cause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granger_causality)
the presence of depressed and anxious moods in a lag-2 vector autoregression.
