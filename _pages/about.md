I am a second year PhD student at [Penn State University](https://ist.psu.edu/prospective/graduate/phd-informatics) in the [Wellbeing and Health Innovation Lab](https://whilab.org) advised by <a href="https://saeedabdullah.com">Dr
Saeed Abdullah</a>. **I'm interested in technical HCI for mental health** and am currently working on understanding how social personal informatics can aid in the long-term management of bipolar disorder.

I am a long-time advocate for mental health issues and am open about my lived experience with bipolar disorder. I founded Penn
State's [Active Minds](https://www.activeminds.org) chapter back in 2010. If this sort of thing interests you, **you may want to check out my essay [Nobody Falls Halfway](/nobody-falls-halfway/)**.

Previously **I led the [digital transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_transformation)** of what was one of the country's largest and highest-quality closely-held Medicaid groups, [Smiles 4 Keeps Pediatric Dentistry](https://www.smiles4keeps.com). With minimal supervision and years of close mentorship by its owner, I stewarded this unique group from paper operations to centralized (and salable) operations by integrating [OpenDental](https://www.opendental.com) in the midst of a cross-generational transfer of family leadership.
