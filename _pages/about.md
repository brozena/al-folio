I am a PhD candidate at [Penn State University](https://ist.psu.edu/prospective/graduate/phd-informatics) in the [Wellbeing and Health Innovation Lab](https://whilab.org) advised by [Dr Saeed Abdullah](https://saeedabdullah.com). **I'm interested in technical HCI for mental health**. 

My research centers on understanding how open banking technologies can **help with the unique financial challenges faced by those living with bipolar disorder**. I'm working towards (1) creating novel assessments of financial data that model distinct changes to mood and spending behaviors, and (2) designing collaborative, timely interventions that support long-term financial wellbeing across all phases of this illness.

My work is currently supported by the National Science Foundation via the Graduate Research Fellowship Program.

<span data-nosnippet>I am a long-time advocate for mental health issues and am open about my lived experience with bipolar disorder. I founded Penn State's [Active Minds](https://www.activeminds.org) chapter back in 2010. If this sort of thing interests you, **you may want to check out my essay [Nobody Falls Halfway](/nobody-falls-halfway/)**.</span>

Previously **I led the [digital transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_transformation)** of what was one of the country's largest and highest-quality closely-held Medicaid groups, [Smiles 4 Keeps Pediatric Dentistry](https://www.smiles4keeps.com). With minimal supervision and years of close mentorship by its owner, I stewarded this unique group from paper operations to centralized (and salable) operations by integrating [OpenDental](https://www.opendental.com) in the midst of a cross-generational transfer of family leadership.

I've played [tabla](/tabla) since 2009 or so. Also, I have some [photography](/gallery/) available for your viewing pleasure.
