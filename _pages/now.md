The PhD news: Year four is underway. I'm currently recruiting for an interview/data collection study involving [money behaviors and bipolar disorder](https://whilab.org/projects/bd-finhealth.html). We're aiming to design personalized, privacy-preserving, supportive financial technologies tailored to this illness. These days I'm pinching myself that I get to think about this so deeply.

I'll be traveling to Japan for [CHI 2025](https://chi2025.acm.org/) where I'm co-organizing a workshop [The Future of Money and HCI](https://chi2025.acm.org/for-authors/workshops/accepted-workshops/#w3). I'm also planning to attend [ISBD 2025](https://www.isbd.org/2025annualconference). So I'll be running laps to Tokyo. Thankfully.

I have an gig scheduled in mid-April at the Center for Wellbeing in Lemont, PA. I'll perform on [tabla](/tabla) with [Open Music](https://openmusicpa.org/). This will a special one, deliberately acoustic instruments only. Previously I have joined Open Music for a performance of [In C](https://openmusic.bandcamp.com/album/in-c). Details and a recording to follow.

PS. I'm really enjoying reading [Ways of Seeing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ways_of_Seeing) by [John Berger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Berger). I'm also excited for [All Media is Training Data](https://shop.serpentinegalleries.org/products/holly-herndon-mat-dryhurst-all-media-is-training-data) by [Holly Herndon & Mat Dryhurst](https://herndondryhurst.studio/).
