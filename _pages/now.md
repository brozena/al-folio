Here comes year three of a [PhD in
informatics](https://ist.psu.edu/prospective/graduate/phd-informatics) at Penn
State advised by [Dr Saeed Abdullah](https://saeedabdullah.com) in the
[Wellbeing and Health Innovation Lab](https://whilab.org/). Courses are
wrapping up through winter. PSU's [QuantDev](https://quantdev.ssri.psu.edu/) is
offering a series of methods courses that I'm really looking forward to.
Gratefully, the next three years will be funded by a National Science
Foundation [Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/).

I'm still cozied up at home under Mt. Nittany in Lemont, PA. Grad school has
[rendered me monastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Glass_Bead_Game) for
awhile. Submitting to this little endeavor has required me to redefine meanings
of work, attention, and time. But in a word, I'm enjoying the monastery.
